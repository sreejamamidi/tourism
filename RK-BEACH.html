            <p style="font-size: 18; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;">Ramakrishna beach, more popularly known as RK beach in Visakhapatnam is located in the 
                heart of the city’s coastline. If you stand in the middle, on the right you can see the Dolphin’s Nose and on the left, you can 
                see the INS Kursura parked just by One evening we just strolled past the beach after visiting the Naval Museum and Submarine 
                museum, and it was a pleasure to see the various art installations on the beach. I have not seen this anywhere else in India.
                There were mermaids and maidens at the base of the lampposts. There is a park that has sculptures that imitate the Buddhist 
                sculptures reminding the visitors that Buddhism flourished in this place in the past, and there is a monastery not too far from
                this beach.

                There are modern sculptures depicting kids, traditional ones depicting fishermen with their boats and cultural ones depicting
                conch shells. There are small temples or statues providing a bit of divinity. I would not say they are the best art installations
                you would see, but nonetheless, add color to the beachside and break the monotony.
