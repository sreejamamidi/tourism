            <h2 style="text-align: center; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">MECCA-MASJID , HYDERABAD</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 18; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;">Mecca Masjid, is one of the oldest mosques
                in Hyderabad, Telangana in India, and it is one of the largest masjids in India. Makkah Masjid is a listed heritage building in the
                old city of Hyderabad, close to the historic landmarks of Chowmahalla Palace, Laad Bazaar, and Charminar. Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah,
                the fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, commissioned bricks to be made from the soil brought from Mecca, the holiest site of Islam,
                and used them in the construction of the central arch of the mosque, thus giving the mosque its name. It formed the centerpiece around 
                which the city was planned by Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah. On the edge of the pond for wudu are two stone and slab benches, whoever sits on
                them, according to legend, returns to sit on them. A room in the courtyard is believed to house a hair of Prophet Muhammed (PBUH).

            T   This was probably my second sightseeing trip of Hyderabad after moving to this historic city. My friend Srinu and I reached Charminar 
                around 7 am, since tourists are allowed inside only after 9 am, we decided to hang around. We decided to see the magnificent mosque. 
                I loved the elevation; the 5 arches between 2 minars is simple but a beautiful design. The mosque's gateway seems to be well preserved; 
                the pair of tall wooden doors though coated with green enamel paint seem ancient because of the presence of brass studs which were definitely 
                old. As we stepped through the gate, it was clear that pigeons had taken over this monument, hundreds of them fluttered around, feeding on 
                grains spread on the floor; these pigeons are pampered brats!
