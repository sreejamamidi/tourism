            <h2 style="text-align: center; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">CHARMINAR , HYDERABAD</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 18; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;">Hyderabad is also quite popular amongst 
                tourists and travellers alike, for it is home to some of the most notable monuments. And when we are talking about monuments, how
                can we miss out on the most exemplary, Hyderabad ka Charminar. There are many places to visit in Hyderabad but Charminar is more 
                than just a tourist destination. Surrounded by local markets and several other tourist attractions, Charminar of Hyderabad can 
                be an enriching experience for travellers.
                <br>
                Constructed in 1591, Charminar is both a monument and mosque. Perched on the east bank of the Musi river, Charminar in Hyderabad
                represents the city and is officially affiliated as the Emblem of Telangana. Apart from being a famous tourist spot, Charminar holds
                significant importance with a rich history. Charminar was built by the fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah.
                The history behind Charminar’s construction is as interesting as the Charminar itself. There’s not one but multiple theories. One of the
                theories about Charminar is that it was built to celebrate the eradication of the plague during that time. While according to a French 
                traveller, Jean de Thévenot, the Charminar was constructed by Qutb Shah who also founded the city of Hyderabad to commemorate the commencement 
                of the second Islamic millennium year in the year 1591 CE.
                <br>
                The architecture of Charminar is another stunning element. With a mosque at the western end of the top floor which is an open roof,
                The Charminar masjid is a square structure. There is also a Vazu, right in the centre with a small water fountain for Wudu, which means
                ablution before the prayer.
