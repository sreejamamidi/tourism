            <h2 style="text-align: center; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">KAMBALAKONDA , VISAKHAPATNAM</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 18; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif ; text-align: justify;">This is actually a wildlife sanctuary and now made as an eco -park ,perhaps for boosting 
                tourism. It is approximately 15km from the city, and would take nearly 30-40 mins. The gate is exactly opposite the zoo front
                gate. Parking can be done on payment inside. There is a vehicle trail which goes quite deep. It is sad, that vehicles are permitted;
                also there is an area marked for picnics. On auspicious occasions, one can find even Puja being performed here. There is a lake
                in the centre where kayaking is conducted on payment. Ideally, the place has great trails for trekking. It is common to also
                see litter and plastic being permitted. Coming back to the interesting part, the trekking , one should be at the entrance by
                0600. If you want a guide you have to inform 24 hrs in advance. There are three marked trails 2,3&5km. Post monsoon the area gets completely covered with 
                creepers and dense thorny bushes.
                <br>
                Going without a guide or without prior knowledge can easily result in disorientation. 
                Post monsoon, there would be few water trails in 3&5km trail, where one can use water. Again , one needs to be careful from 
                where water is being collected. If you have knee problems, or asthama. It is not advisable. The trek, only in a few places 
                is challenging, otherwise only average fitness is required. Good shoes (with grip), whistle, minimum of two litres of water, 
                fruits, cap, smurf and a stick are few standard pre-requisites. Mobile range is erratic, but exists as you gain height. 
                Remember, keep a place as clean or cleaner than before when you walk. Several places, the information board on trees has 
                fallen. I wish someone could guide during the trail on how to identify the trees and how to use the medicinal plants, soon 
                it would be history. You will need a minimum of two to six hours. There is a cafeteria inside the eco park, next to where 
                the trail starts.
