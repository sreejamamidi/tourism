        <p style="font-size: 20; padding-left: 100; padding-right: 100; text-align: justify;">The idea of a 2050 Ambitions Registry was built into the Paris 2015 Agreement, as a way for Parties to declare and increase their carbon
            reduction ambitions through 2050, so keeping global temperatures at levels suitable for human survival.
            The Registry is open to all Travel & Tourism companies and communities, whether or not they have created a 2050 Climate Action Plan yet. 
            It covers transport, hospitality, travel service and infrastructure providers – from the smallest to the largest.
            <br>

            visibility Hubs, to develop their plans.Our Climate Friendly Travel DASH-2-Zero initiative is designed to accelerate concrete resilience

            In celebration of World Tourism Day, and its theme of “Rethinking Tourism,” SUNx Malta has launched a new Podcast series, designed to help
            tourism companies and communities to stay on target for the Paris 1.5 degrees temperature limit.
            Announcing this, SUNx Malta President Professor Geoffrey Lipman said “Our goal is to encourage tourism stakeholders to take concrete actions
            to respond to the Code Red Climate Crisis and publicly stand behind them.”.A travel website is a website that provides travel reviews, trip fares,
            or a combination of both. Over 1.5 billion people book travel per year, 70% of which is done online.
            <br>

            Travel bargain websites collect and publish bargain rates by advising consumers where to find them online (sometimes but not always through a direct link).
            Rather than providing detailed search tools, these sites generally focus on offering advertised specials, such as last-minute sales from travel 
            suppliers eager to deplete unused inventory; therefore, these sites often work best for consumers who are flexible about destinations and other 
            key itinerary components.
